Instructions for each level
(I refer to vertical red blocks as WALLS and horizontal ones as PLATFORMS, labelling from left to right 1,2...)


1) Is just a simple jumping exercise

2)Wall 1 is to be moved down a single block so the player can jump over it
Wall 2 may need to be moved up to gain access to the green ledge (depends on the jump height)
Regardless of this, wall 2 needs ot be moved up 1 block to allow the player to get to the exit

3) Platform 1 to be UNDRAWN initially, player it to click on it and draw it to make it solid
Platform 2 is designed to be given velocity to the right to allow the player to jump on the high green wall.
