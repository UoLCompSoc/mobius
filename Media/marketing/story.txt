Story (Non mathematical translation below…)

You play as Blip who is tasked with replacing all missing processors in his neighbourhood motherboard.  Blips universe is not like ours, it is homotopic to a circle, however is constructed from the identification of a square with opposing directions on one set of parallel sides.  This construction gives us a non orientable surface which is self-intersecting in the plane, with right-handed chirality when considered embedded in a Euclidian domain.  The single boundary of the surface that Blip lives on makes the smallest of motherboards infinitely long with periodicity 2.  If you have a hard time visualising this, simply consider it as the nontrivial bundle over the circle with the bundle being the unit interval.

Blip is not of this world, he lives in non-orientable universe, known to us as a möbius strip, which makes his job sometimes require a bit of forward thinking…
